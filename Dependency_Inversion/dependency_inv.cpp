// This violates the Dependency Inversion Principle

// Now, presence of concrete class hampers the addition of another functionality. Suppose, if we need to add bluetooth functionality to MacBook we canâ€™t since it depends on concrete class.

// To avoid this, we take interface class

public:
    MacBook(const Keyboard& keyboard, const Mouse& mouse) 
        : keyboard(keyboard), mouse(mouse) {
        // Constructor Injection
    }
};
// Now, we can create different implementations of Keyboard and Mouse
